To represent (-4) in binary, we need to use a system that can handle negative numbers. The most common method for this is **Two's Complement** representation. Let's break down the steps to get the binary representation of (-4) using an 8-bit system as an example:

### Steps:

1. **Find the binary representation of the absolute value**: 
   - The absolute value of (-4) is (4).
   - The binary representation of (4) in an 8-bit system is (0000_0100).

2. **Invert the bits (One's Complement)**:
   - Inverting all the bits of (0000_0100) gives (1111_1011).

3. **Add 1 to the inverted bits (Two's Complement)**:
   - Adding 1 to (1111_1011):
     
     1111_1011
   + 0000_0001
     
     - This results in (1111_1100).

So, the binary representation of (-4) in an 8-bit Two's Complement system is (1111_1100).

### Verification:

To verify, we can convert (1111_1100) back to a decimal number:

1. **Check the sign bit**: The leftmost bit (most significant bit) is 1, indicating a negative number.
2. **Invert the bits**: (1111_1100) becomes (0000_0011).
3. **Add 1**: (0000_0011 + 1 = 0000_0100).
4. **Convert to decimal**: (0000_0100) is (4).

Since we started with a negative number, the result is (-4).

Therefore, the 8-bit binary representation of (-4) is indeed (1111_1100).

Certainly! Let's express the range of values an 8-bit number can represent in terms of powers of 2.

### 1. Unsigned 8-bit Integer:

An unsigned 8-bit integer can represent values from \(0\) to \(2^8 - 1\).

- **Minimum value**: \(0\) (which is \(0\))
- **Maximum value**: \(2^8 - 1\) (which is \(255\))

### 2. Signed 8-bit Integer (Two's Complement):

A signed 8-bit integer can represent values from \(-2^{7}\) to \(2^{7} - 1\).

- **Minimum value**: \(-2^7\) (which is \(-128\))
- **Maximum value**: \(2^7 - 1\) (which is \(127\))

### Summary in terms of powers of 2:

- **Unsigned 8-bit integer range**: \(0\) to \(2^8 - 1\) (which is \(0\) to \(255\))
- **Signed 8-bit integer range**: \(-2^7\) to \(2^7 - 1\) (which is \(-128\) to \(127\))
